        <img src="ladakh image.jpg" alt="" height="315px" width="560px">

        <p>Ladakh meaning "land of high mountain passes" is a mountainous region in North India. Leh, the main city is
            situated at 3500m above sea level nestled in the great Himalayan, Karakoram, Zanskar and Ladakh ranges.
            Ladakh is known for remote mountain beauty.Due to its high altitude, Ladakh is always freezing cold and dry
            for most of the year. The air is so thin that you can feel the sun's heat intensely. In summers, the
            temperature during the day is just above zero degrees and the night temperature is much below -30Â°C.
